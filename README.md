# TreeCNN Reasoning Prototype
### Hierarchical Neural-Symbolic AI Architecture

**Author:** Bhuvanesh M  
**Project Type:** Research Prototype  
**Focus:** AI Reasoning • Modular Intelligence • Neural-Symbolic Systems  

## Project Status

⚠️ Research Prototype  

This project demonstrates architectural exploration and reasoning design concepts.  
It is not production-ready and serves as a foundation for future experimentation.

---

## Overview

TreeCNN is a research prototype exploring a **hierarchical reasoning architecture** built using a tree-structured network of modular expert nodes.

Instead of relying on a single monolithic neural network, this system demonstrates how intelligence can be structured through layered expert reasoning and adaptive decision flow.

This repository contains a prototype notebook demonstrating the architectural concept and reasoning pipeline.

## Motivation

Traditional neural networks:

- Process information in flat layers  
- Lack structured reasoning flow  
- Provide limited interpretability  

TreeCNN explores:

- Hierarchical reasoning  
- Modular expert intelligence  
- Adaptive routing of information  
- Structured and interpretable decision flow

## Core Ideas Demonstrated

### Hierarchical Processing
Information flows through structured reasoning layers instead of flat transformations.

### Expert Specialisation
Each node simulates domain-specific reasoning behavior.

### Adaptive Routing
Input flows dynamically depending on contextual signals.

### Interpretability
The reasoning tree makes decision flow easier to inspect and understand.
